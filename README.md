Demographic Analysis of Patients Registered at a GP Practice
Project Overview


This project aims to analyze the demographic data of patients registered at a GP practice, focusing on the age and gender distribution of patients. The analysis includes various visualizations to illustrate significant trends and patterns in the data.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

AGES: Age groups of patients.
FEMALE: Number of female patients in each age group.
MALE: Number of male patients in each age group.
Visualizations
Bar Chart for Age Distribution by Gender:

Compares the number of male and female patients across different age groups.
Pie Chart for Gender Distribution:

Shows the overall percentage of male and female patients.
Line Chart for Trends Across Age Groups:

Visualizes trends in the number of male and female patients across age groups.
Stacked Column Chart of Patients by Age Groups:

Displays the cumulative number of patients (male and female) across age groups.
Analysis and Insights
Key Observations
Bar Chart:

Higher number of patients in the age groups 50-59 years and 60-69 years.
Balanced distribution of male and female patients in most age groups.
Pie Chart:

Nearly equal distribution with females at 51.1% and males at 48.9%.
Line Chart:

Increase in the number of patients from age 40 to 64 years.
Decline in the number of patients from age 70 years onwards.
Stacked Column Chart:

Age groups 50-59 years and 60-64 years have the highest total number of patients.
Balanced distribution of male and female patients across most age groups.
Significant Trends and Patterns
Middle-Aged to Senior Populations:

There is a significant increase in the number of patients from age 50 to 64 years, indicating the need for targeted healthcare services for middle-aged to senior populations.
Elderly Populations:

Decline in the number of patients in older age groups (75+ years) might be due to factors such as mortality rates or lower registration rates among elderly patients.
Recommendations for Further Analysis
Investigate the reasons behind the high number of patients in the 50-64 years age groups.
Conduct a deeper demographic analysis to understand the healthcare needs and challenges of different age groups.
